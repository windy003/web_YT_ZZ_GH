        "description": "What do we mean when we mention \"the age of accountability\"? That concept infers that children are not held accountable by God for their sins until they reach a certain age. \n\nIs the concept of an age of accountability biblical? \n\nDoes the Bible define an “age of innocence”?\n\nIn our Bible study today I would like to answer these three questions.\n\n1 - Where is the \"age of accountability\" mentioned in the Scripture?\n\n2 - Why do many Christians claim the age of accountability as 12-13 years old?\n\n3 - What happens to children who die before they are old enough to understand the Gospel?\n\n-------------------\n\nKey Scriptures for today’s teaching: Matthew 18:1-6\n\nOther Scriptures in this teaching: Isaiah 7:14-15; Deuteronomy 1:37-39; 2 Samuel 12:19-23; \n\nUnless otherwise noted, most Scripture will be from the NLT, the New Living Translation\n\nIf you prayed with Tiff, click here https://lostlamb.org/ and let him know! \n\nBe sure to watch the curated playlist “New Beginnings” - https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsX8E19Azl58_FjxELPxjnsL8CAtmama4&si=Pj84Hm2dGX57OH4Z \n\nThank you for watching, and subscribe for new content each week.\n\nConnect with Tiff Shuttlesworth \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/LostLambAssociation/   \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/TIFFSHUTTLESWORTH/ \nTwitter/X: https://twitter.com/tiffshuttleswor\nLearn more about my ministry: https://lostlamb.org/ \nLearn more about my ministry in Canada: https://www.lostlamb.ca",

        "description": "\"Prosperity\" is a biblical word, it is not a \"bad\" word. What is biblical prosperity? Biblical prosperity is defined as having an abundance of resources to fully accomplish God’s will for one’s life, and to serve others.\n\nAccording to the scripture, biblical prosperity is a multifaceted covenant that is rooted in God’s provision and purpose that not only includes material wealth, but also includes spiritual, physical, emotional, and relational strength.\n\nProsperity isn’t a vending machine — it’s the fruit of relationship, obedience, and timing. If you’ve been giving and not prospering, ask the Holy Spirit to search your heart, align your life, and trust that God is faithful to reward those who seek Him (Hebrews 11:6).\n\nChristians who do not manage their money well may struggle to prosper because Scripture teaches that stewardship and diligence are essential to experiencing God’s blessing.\n\nIn today’s study we will learn…\n\nWhat is biblical prosperity?\n\nWhy do the wicked prosper while godly people do not?\n\nDoes the Bible promise material prosperity to all believers?\n\nHow can I get from \"barely getting by\" to \"having an abundance\"?\n\n…and the top 10 reasons why Christians do not prosper!\n\n------------------\n\nKey Scriptures for today’s teaching:  Luke 16:1-13\n\nOther Scriptures in this study: 2 Chronicles 26:5; Proverbs 21:5; Colossians 3:23-25; Proverbs 19:15; Proverbs 15:22; Proverbs 22:7; Proverbs 6:6-8; Proverbs 13:11; Proverbs 21:20; John 6:12; Psalm 84:11; 2 Corinthians 9:6-8; Psalm 112: 1-4 NLT; Matthew 6:33; 3 John 1:2; Psalm 1:1-3; Galatians 6:9\n\nUnless otherwise noted, most Scripture will be from the NLT, the New Living Translation\n\nFor further teachings on angels and demons, see the playlist:\n\nIf you prayed with Tiff, click here https://lostlamb.org/ and let him know! \n\nBe sure to watch the curated playlist “New Beginnings” - https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsX8E19Azl58_FjxELPxjnsL8CAtmama4&si=Pj84Hm2dGX57OH4Z \n\n\nThank you for watching, and subscribe for new content each week.\n\n\nConnect with Tiff Shuttlesworth \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/LostLambAssociation/   \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/TIFFSHUTTLESWORTH/ \nTwitter/X: https://twitter.com/tiffshuttleswor\nLearn more about my ministry: https://lostlamb.org/ \nLearn more about my ministry in Canada: https://www.lostlamb.ca",

Many students of Bible prophecy are not aware that the Old Testament contains more than 500 prophecies pointing to the second coming of the promised Messiah - and I'm sure eyebrows raise when I mention the EXACT day of The Lord's return!\n\n1.

        "description": "What happens to those who have never heard of the gospel? This is a very difficult question that has been asked by almost every thinking Christian at some point in their journey through the Scriptures. There are three popular views on what will happen to those who have never heard the gospel:\n\n1. Christian Pluralism\n\n2. Christian Inclusivism\n\n3. Christian Exclusivism\n\nI will conclude by sharing why I believe only one of these views rests securely in the proper understanding of Scripture.\n\n*Bible Verse reference correction around the 44:30 mark: the chapter and verse is Ecclesiastes chapter 3 verse11 rather than chapter 11 verse 3. The verse shown on screen and read is correct, the Scripture reference is incorrect.*\n\nKey Scriptures for today’s teaching: Romans 1:18-32\n\nOther Scriptures in this study: John 3:16-18, John 14:6, Romans 10:13-18, Acts 4:12, Ecclesiastes 3:11\n\nIf you prayed with Tiff, click here https://lostlamb.org/ and let him know!

        "description": "As you have often heard me teach through the years, there is debate among Christians concerning the timing of the return of the Lord and the doctrine of the Rapture. In recent months we have seen the possibility of a regional war escalating in the Middle East, threats of the use of nuclear weapons, unprecedented floods, back-to-back hurricanes, predictions of another, possibly greater, pandemic, and calls for a one-world government and monetary system. These are the \"signs of the times\" that tell us that the rapture of the church is imminent.\n\nIn today's Bible study, I will cover these 3 questions of great consequence:\n\n1. What does \"imminency\" mean?\n2. What does \"Maranatha\" mean?\n3. Could Jesus return this year?\n\nKey Scriptures for today’s teaching: 1 Corinthians 1:4-9\n\nOther Scriptures in this study: 1 Thessalonians 1:10, James 5:7-9, 1 Corinthians 16:22-24\n\nIf you prayed with Tiff, click here https://lostlamb.org/ and let him know!

In this video I present the facts, the history, the genealogy and the answer to this debated question.\n\nIf you prayed with Tiff, click here https://lostlamb.org/ and let him know!\n\nThank you for watching, and subscribe for new content each week.\n\nWatch more:\nIsrael, War & Final Prophecy \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLP5mKjd9UU\nWhat Does the Bible Say About Cremation? \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXkzgpRTPqw \nShould Christians Celebrate Halloween?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPbQliWIMKk\nPresident Trump's Treaty with Israel & U.A.E & Bible Prophecy\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZIbwe0b-Qo\nUnderstanding The Two Gog and Magog Wars In The Bible\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwUx9grp28M\n8 People Who Will Not Be In Heaven\nhttps://www.youtube.com/live/o4jQZkD6s20\n\nConnect with Tiff Shuttlesworth\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/LostLambAssociation/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/tiffshuttlesworth/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/tiffshuttleswor\n\nLearn more about my ministry: https://lostlamb.org/\nLearn more about my ministry in Canada: https://www.lostlamb.ca",

In this teaching segment, Tiff covers where fasting is spoken about by Jesus in the Bible, and goes over such questions as:\n \n As a Christian, is fasting an option?\n Is it Biblical for a pastor to ask a church family fast and pray?\n What about the Daniel Fast?\n Can I drink coffee or protein shakes on a fast?\n Can I fast with other things instead of food, such as TV or social media?\n What is the difference between fasting for weight loss and fasting Biblically?\n How long should I fast?\n How do I end a fast?\n\nThe key Scriptures for this message:\nMatthew 6:5-18\n\nYou can watch Tiff live on Fridays, 12 noon EST https://www.facebook.com/LostLambAssociation/",
