Have you noticed a change in the use of alcohol in the population?\n- Are the medications used to treat substance abuse different - depending on the drug abused - or are the MoA of these medications aimed to mitigate addiction, broadly?\n- What advice would you give the listeners, if they had a friend or family member who they suspected had a drug addiction?\n- What is withdrawal?",

These are:\n1️⃣Brachialis\n2️⃣Biceps brachii\n3️⃣Brachioradialis\n.\n1️⃣Brachialis - is the deepest of the elbow flexors and will be activated regardless of wrist/forearm position (i.e. supinated, pronated, neutral) and regardless of whether or not the movement is resisted.\n2️⃣Biceps brachii - has origins on the scapula, which means it plays a small role in shoulder flexion. It inserts at the radial tuberosity but also creates a tendon-like sheath called the bicipital aponeurosis that covers the wrist flexors. This is important because when the forearm is supinated it creates an advantageous position for the biceps to flex. When the forearm is pronated, it puts the biceps in a disadvantaged lever arm.\n3️⃣Brachioradialis - is a forearm supinator and pronator and aids in elbow flexion. Many ppl think that it is only activate in neutral and pronated flexion, however, it is more active in supinated flexion, but has an increasing contribution to elbow flexion in the pronated position because the biceps are disadvantaged in pronation.\nA flexion angle of 55 degrees in the semi-prone position seems to be the most optimal position to activate both the biceps and brachioradialis!\nThis means if you want to get a strong bicep curl - use the EZ bar!!\n\nListen to our podcast for more info: https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/dr-matt-and-dr-mikes-medical-podcast/id1270681468",
